## **Project Workflow**
### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Preparation**
- **Dataset**:  
  - **Movies Dataset (`movies.csv`)**: Contains movie IDs, titles, and genres.  
  - **Ratings Dataset (`ratings.csv`)**: Contains user ratings for different movies.  
- **Data Processing**:
  - Exploded genres for easier filtering.
  - Calculated the average rating for each movie.

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Recommendation Algorithms**
#### **üîç Content-Based Filtering (Movie Similarity)**
- Uses **Cosine Similarity** to find similar movies based on user ratings.
- Converts data into a **user-movie rating matrix**.
- Finds the most similar movies to the selected one.

#### **üë§ Collaborative Filtering (User-Based)**
- Uses **Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)** to predict missing ratings.
- Trains a model on user-movie interactions.
- Recommends movies based on predicted ratings for a specific user.

#### **üé≠ Genre-Based Filtering**
- Extracts the **top-rated movies** in a selected genre.
